# Filter + Macro 

Using map and filter to search by variable type with an array.

# Use the Observable macro
The Observable() macro generates source code at compile time that adds observation support to the type. The ViewModel will always be observed by the View without the need to indicate which one to observe.Observation doesnâ€™t require a property wrapper to make a property observable. Instead, the accessibility of the property in relationship to an observer, such as a view, determines whether a property is observable.

* Use of Combine for backend calls.
* URLSession for handling api rest.

# Added Functions
- List of user information.
- Search and filtering by type.
